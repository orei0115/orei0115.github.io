					</p>
					<p>

					</p>
					<p>
						<strong>Answer 7:</strong>
						The tag &lt;timg&gt; is used to add an image. It needs an src attribute &lt;img src&gt; and can be used to put the URL in quotes, or upload it to sublime text. The &lt;alt&gt; will let you define the size and make the image able to be describable for the visually impaired.

						<strong>Question 8:</strong>
						Identify the odd one from these tags: &lt;table&gt; , &lt;tr&gt; , &lt;b&gt; , &lt;td&gt; and state the reason.
					</p>
					<p>
						<strong>Answer 8:</strong>
						The &lt;b&gt; tag is the odd one out because it bolds the text whereas the other three tags are for adding a table, adding table data, and defines the table rows. 
					</p>
				</li>
				<br>	
				<li>
					<p>
						<strong>Question 9:</strong>

				<li>
					<p>
						<strong>Question 10:</strong>
						What is the use of name and value attributes? Give two examples.
					</p>
					<p>
						<strong>Answer 10:</strong>
						They give more information about an element. The name attribute identifies the data one the form is submitted when using the form tag. Value is what will be sent to the servier if the option is selected, for example when creating select boxes with a value of "optiondata"
					</p>
				</li>

						HTML was the only part of the class where I felt like I had a handle on what was happening. The boxes made sense after playing around with them. Unfortunately everything after that didn't sit quite as well with me, so for that reason alone I'll choose HTML.
