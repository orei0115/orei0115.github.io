				Having worked in education for the better part of the last decade I have seen first hand how delayed library technology is compared to other areas of our public school field. The hardware is ancient, good luck finding a cable that isn't bent, and the software used (in my case a program called Alexandria) is slow and tedious to use. Libraries in public education can get money directed to them for books and resources but finding the money for technology is quite difficult. This forces the teacher-librarian or library technician to make do with what they have, and educate themselves on how to use anything new they can find for free. When I saw this class was upon me, I was interested to see what I could learn that might replace what I use currently for library booking schedules, teacher requests, student requests, etc. Currently I use google docs, with an option for anyone to edit the document. There are some ease of use positives, but there is no way for me to block out a section once it's filled meaning that another teacher can kick someone out of a spot. Present company aside - teachers can be quite ruthless, so I wanted a solution to this problem

				Upon opening my final assignemnt I think we'll both agree that I won't be coding any websites any time soon. However, the knowledge of the possibilities gives me an idea for a recess club for the junior students in my school. Since Sublime is a free program, I can use the library's supply of chromes to install sublime and challenge the kids to learn how to code me a new schdule. Since coding has been added to the math curriculum it now means that we have some resources in the school for the kids to try out, plus the useful textbook I purchased for this class can be added to those resources. With the assistance of the grade 6 math teacher, two faculty members will be able to sponsor the club. I'm not certain that GitHub will be an approved site to use, as it's cousin Dropbox isn't allowed. However, I'm certain that even using the sublime program to for writing in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript will be a good start, and though I'm not one of them, many students learn just by fooling around in these programs and trying to figure out what works and what doesn't. I really appreciated being shown the many free to use websites you passed along for fonts, pictures, etc. I have already shown my students the photopia website and have started a photography art project with my grade 4's making double exposures.

				I may never become a competent coder, but a lot of the resources you provided in this class will be used by me for many new projects.
